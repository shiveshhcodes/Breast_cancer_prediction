# Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📖 Overview  
This project is a **web-based application** that predicts the likelihood of breast cancer using a machine learning model. Users can input medical data through a user-friendly interface and receive real-time predictions. The backend hosts a trained model, while the frontend ensures a seamless user experience.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup  
### 📦 Backend (Machine Learning Model)  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd breast-cancer-prediction
   ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment:**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Activate the environment
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Train and save the model:**  
   Run the Jupyter notebook `breast_cancer_predictionv2.ipynb` to train the model and export it.  
5. **Start the backend server (if applicable):**  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### 🌐 Frontend (Website)  
1. **Navigate to the website directory:**  
   ```bash
   cd website
   ```
2. **Run locally:**  
   Open `index.html` in your browser or use a local server.  
3. **Deploy:**  
   Deploy via Netlify or any static site hosting platform.
